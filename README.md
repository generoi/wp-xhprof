# WordPress XHProf-Tideways

> A fork of the wordpress plugin [wp-xhprof](https://github.com/Sut3kh/wp-xhprof).

A WordPress plugin which makes it easy to view XHProf report for the current page request.

If available, the plugin will use the 'tideways' extension instead of xhprof
(xhprof is no longer maintained and does not support php 5.6 or php 7)

_Note: this particular fork fixes incompatibilities with customizer, wp-cli, rest/ajax etc._
